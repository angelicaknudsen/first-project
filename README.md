# first-project
This is my first attempt at programming the Change Up robot (meta design).

It includes code for the drive (tank), intakes (600 rpm I believe), and the uptakes (also 600 rpm).

Since my team isn't going to use this code, I may experiment with my own pseudo design, which would include a mecanum drive.
